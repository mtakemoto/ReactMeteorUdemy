# Udemy React.js & Meteor Course Projects
Learning more about full-stack development by using Meteor, React and MongoDB by to create fully-featured web apps via the course at https://www.udemy.com/meteor-react by Andrew Mead.  I also plan to add my own features to these projects to make them fun and even more useful.   

# Projects
## Score keeper
Add a player and keep track of their score.  Data is persistent by using MiniMongo/MongoDB on the client and server side respectively.  Uses fourseven/meteor-scss for SASS compilation and react-flip-move for smooth transitions when the ladder position of a player changes.

My planned additions to the project:
- [ ] Point/points phrasing logic
- [ ] Global increment score (by 5, 10...etc)
- [ ] Gradient top bar
- [ ] Favicon
- [ ] Animation upon reaching score goal
